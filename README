Simple Slideshow
- Daniel Upton [daniel@ileopard.co]
-----------------------------------

This is a really basic slideshow built in jQuery (nothing fancy!)

Usage
--------
Create a div to hold your slideshow:
<div class="slideshow">
</div>

Add a div to hold your images:
<div class="slideshow">
	<div class="images">
	</div>
</div>

Update the slideshow css with which ever selectors (classes and ID's) you choose.

When the DOM has loaded call:
	$('css-selector').slideshow(); // Yup thats it!
	
Options
--------
Time in milliseconds: (default is 3000)
	$('css-selector').slideshow({ time: 5000 });
